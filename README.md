# bidirectional-search
Created maze search program with NSL.<br>
FMAX is 113.07 Mhz.<br>
The number of execution clocks for the evaluation process of position energy is 12 clocks.<br>
The evaluation process time for position energy is 106 ns.<br>
The processing time on the CPU for the dijkstra method is 28us.<br>
The FPGA we used is EP2AGX45CU17C4.<br>
Parallel processing of bidirectional search is 280 times faster on CPU for dijkstra method.<br>
The CPU clock frequency is 6.2 GHz.<br>
We used intel core i9 14900KS for the CPU.<br>
We used 64GB of RAM (DDR5 4800Mhz) in the CPU.<br>
