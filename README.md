# bidirectional-search
Created maze search program with NSL.<br>
FMAX is 132.05 Mhz.<br>
The number of execution clocks for the evaluation process of position energy is 12 clocks.<br>
The evaluation process time for position energy is 90.9 ns.<br>
The processing time on the CPU for the dijkstra method is 12us.<br>
The FPGA we used is EP2AGX45CU17C4.<br>
Parallel processing of bidirectional search is 132 times faster on CPU for dijkstra method.<br>
The CPU clock frequency is 6.2 GHz.<br>
We used AMD ryzen9 9980 X3D for the CPU.<br>
We used 64GB of RAM (DDR5 6000Mhz) in the CPU.<br>

<br>We set our starting point at 17 and our finishing point at 109.<br>
We evaluated the potential energy and obtained the path using the steepest descent method.<br>
